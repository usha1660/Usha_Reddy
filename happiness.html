        <p style="text-align: center;">
            In a world filled with fleeting pleasures and material pursuits, the quest
            for tune and lastinf happniness ofte eludes us. However, the ancient wisdom
            of Bhagavad Gita offers profound insights on the nature of happniness and its attainment.
            Let us delve into the profound insights offered by the Gita and uncover 
            the path to genuine happiness and contentment.
        </p>
        <h3>
            1. Transitory Nature of Material Happiness
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Gita hightlights that happiness derived from external objects or experiences is transit and subject to change.
            Sensory pleasures and material possessions may bring temporary satisfaction, but they are impermanent
            and cannot provide lastinf fulfillment. The Gita encouraes us to look beyond temporary gratification and seek a deeper
            and more enduring form of happiness. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>"Pleasure from the sences seems like nectar at first, but it is bitter and poison in the end."</span>
        </p>
        <h3>
            2. Inner Fulfillment and Contentment
        </h3>
        <p>
            According to the Gita, true happiness lies within oneself. It teaches that inner fulfillment and contentment arise form aligining our 
            actions, thoughts, anc desires with their dharma and living in accordance with their true nature. By recognizing and fulfilling our
            responsibilities without attachment to results, we can experience a sence of inner contentment and peace.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>"A person can rise through the efforts of his own mind; self-discipline leads to self-realization."</span>
        </p>
        <h3>
            3. Detachment from Desires
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Gita emphasizes the need to cultivate a state of detachmentfrom desires and outcomes. It reaches that attachment to desires leads 
            to mental restlessness and suffering. By letting go of attachment and embracing a more detached attictude, we can find greater equanumity and 
            happiness amidst life's ups and downs.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>"When a person can give up all material desires without being affected by them or desiring them,their mind is then eligible for liberation".</span>
        </p>
        <h3>
            4.Attaining Equilibrium
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Gita teaches that ture happiness can be found by maintaining equilibrium of the mind and emotions.
            It encourages us to cultivate a balanced and steady state of mind, free from excessive attachment, aversion, and fluctuations.
            By developing mental eqyanimity, we can navigate life's challenges with composure and find a deeper sence of happiness 
            and peace.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>"A person is said to be establised in self-realization and is called a yogi whan they can contraol their senses, mind and intellect."</span>
        </p>
        <h3>5. Self-Realization and Ultimate Happiness</h3>
        <p>
            The ultimate teaching of the Gita is that self-realization leads to supreme happiness. By realizing our true nature as the eternal and divine self,
            we transcend the limitations of the material world and experience unshakeable bliss. The Gita suggests that true happiness can be found through spiritual practices,
            self-inquiry and the realization of ones's essential unity with the cosmkic consciousness.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As we strive for happiness, let us remember that it is not a destination but a state of being -  a state that can be realized through self-realization.
